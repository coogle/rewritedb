RewriteDB is a C application which is designed to be used with the Apache Webserver mod\_rewrite module. It allows you to dynamically map arbitrary mod\_rewrite URLs to one or more real URLs. It is useful for site management, or to increase search engine visibility. The backend datbase is sqlite, meaning you can also manipulate the rewrite rules using a language such as PHP without having to reboot the web server.
