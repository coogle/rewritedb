= Introduction =

RewriteDB is a C application which is designed to be used with the Apache Webserver [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/mod_rewrite.html mod_rewrite]module. It allows you to dynamically map arbitrary mod_rewrite URLs to one or more real URLs. It is useful for site management, or to increase search engine visibility. The backend datbaase is [http://www.sqlite.org SQLite], meaning you can also manipulate the rewrite rules using a language such as [http://www.php.net PHP] without having to reboot the web server.
